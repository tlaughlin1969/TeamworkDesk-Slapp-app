# starter-slapp-app

This repository is meant as an example and starting point for building a Slack app on [Beep Boop][bb].  It's written in [node.js](), uses the [Slapp][slapp] library, and takes advantage of the [Slack Events API][slack-events-api].

## Setup Instructions

Once you've created a new [Beep Boop](bb) project with this repo, go to your project's **Settings** tab and enable a Slack App.

Follow the steps laid out in the wizard. You'll want to enable **Event Subscriptions** on your Slack App using the `URL` provided and add subscriptions for the following **Bot Events**:

+ `message.channels`
+ `message.im`ddd

### ðŸ”¥ it up

Once you've finished setting up your Slack App and saved the `Client ID`, `Client Secret` and `Verification Token` on Beep Boop, go ahead and **Start** your project.

### Why is my Bot Offline?

Your bot will not show as "online", which is a current limitation of the [Slack Events API](slack-events-api) (no way to set presence). If you really want your bot to show online, [check out this work-around](presence-polyfill).
